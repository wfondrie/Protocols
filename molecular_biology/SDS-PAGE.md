# SDS-PAGE

We have two buffer systems: Tris-glycine (classic and general purpose) and bis-Tris (more expensive buffers?). I've been using the 4-12% Tris-glycine gels for general purpose SDS-PAGE to western blot

1. Decide how much to load on gel. For a western, generally 10-20 ug of total cell lysate is good.

2. Dilute with the appropriate volume of sample buffer

3. Boil sample to ensure denaturation

4. Assemble gel box. Remember well access should be on the interior.  
5. Fill interior with 1x SDS running buffer

6. Fill exterior 1/3 full with 1x SDS running buffer

7. Run gel at 120V till dye front has migrated to the end of the gel or just off. ~1-2 hrs

8. Proceed to western blot, or stain with Coomassie (but not both!)
